# VRT-Starter (vite, react, tailwindcss)

The most lightweight, vanilla template for React, Vite, & Tailwind CSS.

It's designed to save you a couple minutes of setup time, and give you peace of mind that nothing unnecessary is included or behaving like dead weight.

Got contribution ideas? I'd love to hear them in the issues tab :)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone # or use the template button on this repo
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Steps Used to Create This Template

Ie, what would you need to do if you _didn't_ want to use this template?

```bash
# 1. create initial template
npm init @vitejs/app vrt-starter

# 2. install tailwind and deps
npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest

# 3. create postcss.config.js, then write contents to it (offscript in editor)
touch postcss.config.js

# 4. init tailind
npx tailwindcss init

# 5. finally, (offscript in editor) clear index.css and App.jsx, then delete SVG favicon and App.css
```
